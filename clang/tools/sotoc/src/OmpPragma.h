/// A helper class to rewrite some "pragma omp" (mostly teams and similar
/// combined constructs), which are not supported by sotoc.
/// We currently only support one team to be run on the target because ncc does
/// not support 'freestanding' teams. So we need to remove teams and
/// distribute constructs from the generated target code. But teams constructs
/// can also appear in combined constructs. These combined constructs cannot
/// simply be removed, they must be replace by "non-team" equivalents to
/// preserve correctness.
/// This class provides helper functions that finds a suitable replacement for
/// omp pragmas that contain teams constructs.
/// It is used during code generation: The omp pragma of each target region
/// that is declared as part of a combined construct and each pragma found
/// during pretty printing is encapsulated by an object of this class which is
/// then used to generate a replacement.
